# Language Model Chatbot Project

## Start with Why
Besides being an engineer and an AI enthusiast, I am a Founding Member at [No Pressure Improv](https://www.instagram.com/nopressureimprov/) - a performing arts group in Bangalore. As the name suggests, we improvise! ([And adapt, and overcome!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/987/overcome.jpg))

There is a lot of curiosity around improv. That means a lot of people want to know about improv! *(Yay!)* And also that people have to answer those questions a lot of time. *(Oh...)*

## Enter AI
This chatbot project is designed to leverage Google Gemini and LangChain, along with a custom dataset of frequently asked questions (FAQs) from my improv troupe.
This is going to be implemented on our website, so that commonly asked questions about improv can be answered with AI. Like magic!

### Project Features

#### Chatbot Implementation:
* Utilizes Google Gemini and LangChain to create an intelligent and interactive chatbot.
* Trained on a custom dataset consisting of FAQs from my improv troupe to enhance contextual understanding.

#### FAQ Dataset:
* Curated a dataset specifically tailored to the unique queries and expressions commonly encountered within the improv community.
* The dataset enriches the chatbot's ability to provide relevant and context-aware responses.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress
The current focus of this project is to address dependencies related to the language model to ensure smooth functionality and compatibility by **migrating to LCEL**.

## Demo/ How to see this Chatbot in Action

* I am still working on the migration process. However, you cna still check out the code! 
* I have uploaded this project as a [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HuqM1v9GQDqWaXM8i5VG7CCRh1kZtX8J?usp=sharing). 
* To run this notebook
    1. Copy the notebook into your Drive, 
    2. Download the dataset from [here](improv-llm-qna/improv-qna.csv)
    3. Upload onto Colab's directory
    4. Run the cells

*Voila!*
